We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors and users of the Alien Defender game. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all participants to:

- **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with respect and kindness. This includes being considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- **Be Inclusive**: Welcome individuals from all backgrounds and encourage diverse participation in the community.
- **Communicate Constructively**: Use constructive language when giving feedback or criticism. Focus on ideas, not individuals.
- **Foster a Positive Environment**: Help create a friendly and supportive atmosphere. Engage in discussions that promote collaboration and growth.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- **Harassment**: Any form of harassment, including offensive comments, threats, and intimidation.
- **Discrimination**: Discriminatory language or behavior based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected status.
- **Trolling**: Deliberately provoking or upsetting others for personal amusement.
- **Spamming**: Excessive posting of irrelevant or repetitive messages.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the maintainers of the project. You can do this by contacting us via GitHub at [DhanushNehru](https://github.com/DhanushNehru) or through our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1222133346302300230/@home). All reports will be handled promptly and confidentially.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who engage in unacceptable behavior may be warned, banned, or removed from the community, depending on the severity of the behavior. We take these matters seriously and will not tolerate any actions that undermine the positive and inclusive atmosphere we strive to maintain.
