# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in reporting them. If you find any security issues within the Alien Defender game repository, please follow these steps to report them:

- **Contact us on Discord**: Join our Discord channel [here](https://discord.com/invite/Yn9g6KuWyA) and contact the team directly.
- **Version Information**: This policy applies to version **2.0** of the Alien Defender game.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Potential impact of the vulnerability.

We aim to respond to security reports within **10 working days** and will work quickly to address any valid vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We recommend using version **2.0** or later, as previous versions are no longer supported for security updates.

## Security Practices

- Regular security audits are conducted on our codebase.
- We encourage all developers to follow secure coding practices.
- The community is encouraged to report security concerns via our Discord or other official communication channels.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is reported and confirmed, we will work to resolve it as quickly as possible. The timeline for public disclosure will be coordinated with the person who reported the issue. Typically, we aim for a disclosure window of **10 working days** after the fix is deployed.
